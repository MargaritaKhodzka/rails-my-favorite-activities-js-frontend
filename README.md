Create a personal fork of the project on Github.
Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called origin.
Add the original repository as a remote called upstream.
If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
Create a new branch to work on! Branch from develop if it exists, else from master.
Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
Follow the code style of the project, including indentation.
Add or change the documentation as needed.
Squash your commits into a single commit with git's interactive rebase. Create a new branch if necessary.
Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote origin.
From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's develop branch if there is one, else go for master!
...
Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from upstream to your local repo and delete your extra branch(es).
